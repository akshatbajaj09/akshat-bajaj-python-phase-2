# There are many different ways in which we can import Python modules like:
# Directly importing the whole module
import random

# Importing the module with an alias
import random as r

# Importing a specific function of our interest from the module instead of
# importing the whole module
from random import shuffle

# Importing a specific function with an alias
from random import shuffle as s
